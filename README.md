# Multiedit

This is a project I began while messing around with extending the
[ClojureScript One](https://github.com/brentonashworth/one) repo.

## What's here

Right now only a portion of the intended functionality is implemented,
namely you can create and save notes (using localStorage). In the future
I would like to modify the backend to allow for collaborative editing.

## Getting started

Basically the same as ClojureScript One:

    git clone https://github.com/pandeiro/multiedit.git
    cd multiedit
    lein bootstrap
    lein repl

At the REPL prompt which appears, type `(go)`. Your browser will
launch and navigate to the running application.
